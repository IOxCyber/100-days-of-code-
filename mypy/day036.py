    Modules are pieces of code.
    
    People have written to fulfill common tasks &
    such as generating random numbers ,
    performing mathematical operations.
    
    The code uses the randint function defined in the random module to print
    random numbers.
    
    The basic way to use a module is to add import module_name at the top of your code,
    and then using module_name.var to access functions.
